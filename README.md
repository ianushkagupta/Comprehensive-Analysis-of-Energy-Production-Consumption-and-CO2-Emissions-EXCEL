# Comprehensive-Analysis-of-Energy-Production-Consumption-and-CO2-Emissions

This project aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of energy production, consumption, and CO2 emissions trends and variations across different countries and regions using yearly data. The analysis will cover a wide range of factors including CO2 emissions from fuel consumption, average CO2 emission factor, total energy production and consumption, share of renewables in electricity production, share of electricity in total final energy consumption, oil products domestic consumption and refined oil products production, natural gas production and domestic consumption, electricity production and domestic consumption, coal and lignite domestic consumption and production, share of wind and solar in electricity production, trend in crude oil production, and coal and lignite production. The project aims to provide insights into the trends, patterns, and variations in energy production, consumption, and CO2 emissions among different countries and regions, and contribute to a better understanding of global energy dynamics and sustainability challenges.
